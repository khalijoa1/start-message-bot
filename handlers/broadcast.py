"""Broadcast a single message to everyone who has ever pressed /start on
this bot.

The audience builds itself automatically: every /start command (see
handlers/start.py) upserts the sender into BotUser via record_bot_user()
below. Telegram lets a bot message any user who has started a
conversation with it, so recording on /start is exactly the right (and
only) qualifying interaction - nothing here scrapes contacts or messages
anyone who hasn't opened a chat with the bot themselves.
